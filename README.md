# 🌾 Farming Game

A cozy farming game built using the **Godot Engine** through following a tutorial. Inspired by classic farming sims, this game lets you plant crops, harvest them, and enjoy a peaceful pixel world that I designed from scratch.

> 🧑‍🌾 As someone who loves farming games, this was a fun project, especially seeing the map and game come to life!

## 🎮 Gameplay
Plant seeds, wait for them to grow, then harvest! Move around the map and interact with your crops in your own small farming paradise.
